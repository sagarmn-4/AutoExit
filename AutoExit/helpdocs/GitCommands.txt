🧭 Undoing or Reverting Commits (Safely)
🧩 1️⃣ Undo changes before commit (i.e. not yet committed)

If you changed some files but haven’t committed yet:

git restore .


This resets everything to the last committed state (like “undo all uncommitted changes”).

If you only want to undo one file:

git restore filename.py

🪄 2️⃣ Undo the last commit but keep changes

Maybe you committed too early, but want to re-edit before pushing:

git reset --soft HEAD~1


✅ Keeps your code changes
❌ Removes the last commit
You can then re-edit and recommit.

🚫 3️⃣ Undo the last commit completely (delete it and its changes)

If the last commit was wrong and you want to completely discard it:

git reset --hard HEAD~1


⚠️ This removes that commit and all its file changes.
Use carefully — it’s like “go back in time.”

🔁 4️⃣ Revert a commit after pushing to GitHub

If you already pushed a commit to GitHub but it was wrong:

git log


Copy the commit hash (something like a1b2c3d4).

Then:

git revert a1b2c3d4


This creates a new commit that undoes the effects of the chosen one (safe way — never deletes history).

Finally push:

git push

📜 5️⃣ See commit history
git log --oneline
